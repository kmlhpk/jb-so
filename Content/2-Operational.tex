        decision must be made before the next scheduled Meeting.
        \item A JCR Emergency Meeting can be called, at the discretion of the JCR Chair, to discuss any
        issue that either cannot be delayed until the next JCR General Meeting and / or is deemed
        to be of sufficient importance to deserve immediate attention.
        \item A minimum of 24 hours’ notice must be given before an emergency meeting,
        and a quoracy count must be taken before the meeting begins.

        \item All JCR members shall pay an agreed membership fee. The JCR Membership Levy shall be £135
        (including VAT), chargeable to 1st year Undergraduates in the first college bill. This levy confers
        membership of the JCR for the first three years of an undergraduate degree. In particular

        proportion of the JCR Membership Levy and confer a relevant number of years of membership, as

        term of paid JCR membership expires, a member shall be entitled to a refund from the JCR
        dependant on the number of complete years remaining of their membership term. This refund
        shall be at a rate of one third of the JCR Membership Levy as was in effect at the time of the JCR
        member’s matriculation to the university per complete unused year of membership. Refunds shall
        only be payable where a request for a refund is made in writing by a JCR member to the current
        JCR President, and such requests will only be accepted if made within 2 calendar months of the
        JCR member ceasing to be a student at Josephine Butler College.

        within their degree or by changing to a different degree programme, shall be charged an
        additional membership fee. This fee shall be equal to one third of the current JCR Membership
        Levy per restarted year, and confers the relevant number of additional years of JCR membership.

        JCR Meeting.

            contributed exceptional commitment, diligence and excellence in services to the JCR
            throughout their college life.
            \item \textbf{The Community Award} may be granted to a person, persons or organisation external

    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\hiddensection{\large{JCR Committees}}
\SectionTitle{\thesection}{JCR Committees}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Roles and Organisation
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A committee of the JCR differs from a society in that it acts to benefit the JCR as a whole, and not only those who are members of it.
        \item Committees, alongside their specific roles within the JCR community, should also strive to continually encourage increased involvement and membership.
        \item Any committee may be asked to submit a brief written report about their activities for the next General JCR meeting by any member of the JCR. The request must be made at least 10 days before the next meeting to give the committee sufficient time to prepare the report. This report should be sent to the JCR Chair to be included in the agenda 7 days before a general JCR Meeting, and the committee chair may also be called upon to answer any relevant questions asked of them at a JCR meeting by a JCR member. Failure to write a report without suitable reason when requested to do so may invoke a ‘Question of Officers Conduct’ under 8.
        \item Committees may have internal roles, which are elected in a committee meeting by the committee which they serve by anonymous vote. For committees where minutes are taken, it should be assured that voting members are active members of the committee by checking the attendance list, however people running need not be active members. The JCR Chair and their vice chairs should be present for such elections to make sure they are conducted fairly. The internal roles should be advertised in the following JCR meetings and elections conducted before the next JCR Meeting:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item First meeting of Michaelmas Term: Deputy Mound Editor(s).
            \item Second meeting of Michaelmas Term: Assistant Charity Coordinator(s), Charity Comm
            Treasurer, Assistant DSU Rep.
            \item Third meeting of Michaelmas Term: Assistant Green Committee Rep(s) (Individual or Pair).
            \item Second meeting of Epiphany Term: Assistant Food Services Officer (Individual), Assistant Social Chair (4 Individuals).
            \item Third meeting of Epiphany Term: Assistant Societies Officer (2 Individuals), Assistant Sports Officer (2 Individuals), Assistant Publicity Officer (Individual).
            \item First meeting of Easter Term: Assistant International Officer (2 Individuals).
            \item Second meeting of Easter Term: RT Projects Leader (Individual), Inter-generational Project Leader (Individual).
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Resignation From Committees
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item For all JCR Committees (excluding members of exec where mandated to attend), if a person holding an elected position fails to attend three consecutive meetings of the Committee without making any apologies, or four consecutive meetings with apologies, he or she will be considered to have stepped down from the position, which will then go up for election at the next General/Emergency Meeting of the JCR, or for internal roles at the next General/Emergency Committee Meeting.
        \item The JCR Chair and Vice-chairs must be notified of any resignations as soon as possible.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\hiddensection{\large{JCR Societies}}
\SectionTitle{\thesection}{JCR Societies}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Roles and Organisation
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A JCR Society is a recreational organisation within the JCR which benefits its members but not necessarily the whole JCR or college.
        \item A society is not required to specifically produce anything for the college but if appropriate should assist with JCR events and campaign weeks.
        \item Society Presidents are elected at compulsory AGMs, which should be recorded and sent to the JCR Societies Officer. They must then report to the JCR Societies Officer each term about the progress of the society and a report on the progress of the budget when appropriate, as well as any changes to the structure of the society. It is compulsory that they attend the freshers’ fair or send a member of the society as a delegate.
        \item Societies should constantly strive to increase and improve membership throughout the year and should attempt to have at least three meetings in a term, unless a valid reason is given.
        \item If a society is not run at all in a term, without a valid reason, it will be considered without a president and then an EGM must be held, and minutes must be taken.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Ratification
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A recreational group may be ratified by the JCR as a society if the JCR believes that it currently has (and will continue to have) a sustainable membership and will continue to benefit its members. The JCR Societies Officer must approve the ratification before it goes up in the meeting.
        \item Once a society is ratified it may apply for JCR funding or charge a membership fee. Their budget must then be maintained throughout the year by the society president or a member of the society’s exec.
        \item A ratified society may have official association with the Josephine Butler College JCR, and thus may use Josephine Butler within their name.
        \item If the JCR finds that a society has been inactive for at least a year then the society will be de-ratified and will lose the benefits above.
        \item The assets of a de-ratified society must be transferred to another JCR group or back to the JCR as a whole.
        \item There must be a list of ratified societies which is kept and maintained by the Societies Officer.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

        \item The JCR Chair shall invite one person to make a proposition speech (i.e. pro revocation) and one person to make an opposition speech (i.e. against revocation), where possible identified by the JCR Chair before the meeting.

            \item The accused shall be informed of their right to appeal the decision to a college disciplinary hearing as the normal JCR appeals process does not apply in this instance.

    \end{enumerate}
    \item Suspension or Exclusion from the JCR
    \begin{enumerate}
