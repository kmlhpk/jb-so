    \item The DSO Framework and Standing Orders shall be consulted and complied with in all JCR policies, procedures, rules, regulations, decisions and other such matters.
    \item  These Permanent Standing Orders may not be suspended. Any part of the Operational Standing Orders of the JCR may be suspended by a vote at a quorate JCR meeting. Any alternative arrangements established must comply with the DSO Framework and these Permanent Standing Orders.
